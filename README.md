# Requirements
## tesseract
You will need a recent version (>= 4.0.0beta1) of tesseract built with the training tools and matching leptonica bindings. 

Build instructions and more can be found in the [Tesseract project wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

Build tesseract instructions on Windows can be found in the [Tesseract4.0+VS2017+win10](https://livezingy.com/compilation-tesseract4-in-vs2017-win10/).

## Git for Windows
Install the Git for Windows,and add the path where Git / bin is located to the Path path of the environment variable.
